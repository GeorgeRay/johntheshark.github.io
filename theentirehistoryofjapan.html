    <p>Ancient Japan (Prehistoric Period to 710 CE)

      Japan's history begins in the prehistoric era, with archaeological evidence suggesting human habitation as far back as 30,000 BCE. By around 300 BCE, the Yayoi culture emerged, bringing agriculture and metallurgy to Japan. This period saw the formation of early clans and the introduction of rice cultivation.
      
      In the 3rd century CE, Japan came into contact with the Korean Peninsula and China, leading to the adoption of writing systems (kanji) and Buddhism around the 6th century. The Yamato clan, centered in modern-day Nara Prefecture, emerged as a dominant political force, establishing the foundations of centralized rule.
      
      Classical Japan (710–1185 CE)
      
      The Nara Period (710–794 CE) marked Japan's first centralized imperial rule under the Taika reforms. Buddhism flourished, and the capital was moved to Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) in 794 CE, ushering in the Heian Period (794–1185 CE). This era saw the peak of aristocratic culture, including the development of literature such as "The Tale of Genji" by Murasaki Shikibu.
      
      Medieval Japan (1185–1603 CE)
      
      The Kamakura Period (1185–1333 CE) began with the rise of the samurai class and the Kamakura Shogunate. This marked a shift towards feudalism, with military governments (shogunates) holding de facto power. The Mongol invasions in the late 13th century were repelled, solidifying Japanese isolationism.
      
      The Muromachi Period (1336–1573 CE) saw the rise of Ashikaga shogunate, alongside cultural flourishing with tea ceremonies and Noh theater. However, internal conflict (Onin War) led to a period of decentralized power.
      
      Early Modern Japan (1603–1868 CE)
      
      The Edo Period (1603–1868 CE) began with Tokugawa Ieyasu establishing the Tokugawa Shogunate and Edo (modern Tokyo) as the political center. This era was marked by relative peace, strict social hierarchy (samurai, peasants, artisans, merchants), and the development of urban culture. Japan pursued isolationism (sakoku), allowing limited trade with the Dutch and Chinese.
      
      Modern Japan (1868–present)
      
      The Meiji Restoration in 1868 marked Japan's rapid modernization and industrialization, influenced by Western ideas and technology. The Meiji Era (1868–1912) saw the abolition of feudalism, the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, and the rise of nationalism.
      
      Japan emerged as a regional power in the late 19th century, defeating China (First Sino-Japanese War, 1894–95) and Russia (Russo-Japanese War, 1904–05). This period also saw expansion into Korea and Manchuria, leading to tensions with Western powers.
      
      World War I saw Japan allied with the Allies, gaining territories from Germany. The interwar period was marked by economic growth, but also political turmoil and military expansionism in China (Second Sino-Japanese War, 1937–45).
      
      World War II saw Japan allied with the Axis Powers, leading to its defeat in 1945 and subsequent occupation by Allied forces. The post-war period saw Japan rebuild its economy and society, becoming a major economic power by the late 20th century.
      
      Today, Japan is known for its technological innovation, rich cultural heritage, and global influence in various fields.</p>
